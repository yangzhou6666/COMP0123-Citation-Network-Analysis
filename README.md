## Data and Code

### Original Data
The original data set we use is the citation network dataset provided by [AMINER](https://www.aminer.cn/citation). The data we use is [DBLP-Citation-network V11](https://lfs.aminer.cn/misc/dblp.v11.zip). It is more than 10 GB so we cannot upload it on Moodle. You can download the data directly by clicking the link above.

### Extracted Data
We extract 240 (3 * 80) csv files. The screenshot of terminal displays the data we have. We only submit the data of papers (no. of authors $\leq$ 3) since other two folders are two large.

`percentage_of_papers.csv` stores the percentage of papers from 1946 to 2017.

### Jupyter Notebooks
We provide a Jupyter Notebooks for people who are interested in reproducing our results. It also contain the scripts to extract data.

Notice: **Change the file directory for your own computer first**.
