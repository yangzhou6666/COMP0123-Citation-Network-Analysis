# Title:  Analysis of Scientific Collaboration Trends in Papers with Fewer Authors

# Introduction

It is a common sense that the scientific collaboration has been increasing. There are many reasons to such increase. While the Internet connects the world, it also connects scholars and makes it more convenient for them to collaborate with each other. More and more tools are available for scholars, e.g. Overleaf for writing drafts and Github for contributing to codebase. Besides, many scientific research nowadays is interdisciplinary and requires researchers from different domains to collaborate.

On the other side, the number of researchers (e.g. PhDs) is increasing, and many of them want to apply for competitive positions. As an optional measurement for the performance of scientists, the number of papers published can increase via scientific collaboration at a relatively low cost. Scholars often tend to participate in work of different groups to make their resume more outstanding. This kind of collaboration is also double-way: you join my papers and I should join your other work. This is a reciprocal relationship if not consider other factors. The young scholars hope to collaborate with famous scientist to boost their reputation. The scientist of fame can also produce more research achievements. We do not judge whether such motivation is fair, but if we view scientific collaboration network as a market, tending to collaboration more seems to be a dominant strategy. Besides, the success of scholars is not only decided by the number of papers and citations. The networks that scholars are in also influence whether scholars are successful or not. These factors all contributes to the fast increasing in scientific collaboration. 

The main research object in this report is the patterns of trends in scientific collaboration. Many researchers view the collaboration relationship as Simple Graph. Nodes in the graph represent scholars. If two scholars co-published a paper, there is an edge between corresponding nodes. With regarding to with problem, the most classic paper is xxx by *Newman*. *Newman* analysed the collaboration patterns of scholars from different domains and studied some measurements, including: degree distribution, balabalab,  ... and .... He find the common pattern existing in different science fields and such patterns also exist in current collaboration networks [xx].
